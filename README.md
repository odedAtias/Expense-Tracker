## Technologies

## Implementation Remarks

1️⃣ I have added to the project 3 main components that will help me perform the task in a simpler:
1. AllExpenses - Contains all the expenses you added.
2. ManageExpense - A screen where you can manage a specific expense that has been added and perform actions such as editing and deleting.
3. RecentExpense - Contains all the recent expenses from last 7 days you added.

2️⃣ I used the react Context API in order to manage all the global state on the client side.

3️⃣ I implemented Restful services using the baas called firebase.
